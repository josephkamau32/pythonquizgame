## Overview
This is a simple command-line Science Quiz Game written in Python that tests players' knowledge of science facts across various domains including chemistry, biology, astronomy, and anatomy.

## Features
- 5 multiple-choice science questions
- Immediate feedback for each answer
- Score calculation and percentage display
- Simple, clean terminal interface
- End-of-game summary showing correct answers vs player guesses

## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Basic terminal/command prompt to run the program

## Installation
1. Copy the provided Python code into a new file named `science_quiz.py`
2. Save the file to your desired directory
3. No additional dependencies or packages required

## How to Play
1. Open your terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the directory containing `science_quiz.py`
3. Run the game by executing:
   ```bash
   python science_quiz.py
   ```
4. For each question:
   - Read the question carefully
   - Review all options (A, B, C, D)
   - Type your answer (A, B, C, or D) and press Enter
5. After answering all questions, view your final score and performance summary

## Game Structure
The game consists of three main components:

1. **Questions Tuple**:
   - Contains all the science questions
   - Stored in the `questions` variable

2. **Options Tuple**:
   - Contains nested tuples with answer choices for each question
   - Stored in the `options` variable
   - Each inner tuple corresponds to a question

3. **Answers Tuple**:
   - Contains the correct answers for all questions
   - Stored in the `answers` variable

The game logic:
- Iterates through each question
- Displays the question and corresponding options
- Accepts user input
- Compares input against correct answer
- Tracks guesses and calculates score
- Displays final results

## Customization
You can easily modify the game by:

1. **Adding More Questions**:
   - Append new questions to the `questions` tuple
   - Add corresponding options to the `options` tuple
   - Add the correct answer to the `answers` tuple

2. **Changing Topics**:
   - Replace the science questions with questions on any other topic
   - Maintain the same structure of questions, options, and answers

3. **Adjusting Scoring**:
   - Modify the scoring calculation at the end of the game
   - Currently calculates percentage of correct answers

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for the game:

1. **Difficulty Levels**:
   - Implement easy, medium, and hard question sets

2. **Multiple Categories**:
   - Allow players to choose between science, history, pop culture, etc.

3. **Enhanced Feedback**:
   - Add explanations for correct answers
   - Provide fun facts related to questions

4. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Add color to the terminal output
   - Implement ASCII art for better presentation

5. **Player Tracking**:
   - Save high scores
   - Track performance over multiple games

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Validate user input more thoroughly
   - Handle unexpected inputs gracefully
